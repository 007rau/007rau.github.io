                related concepts in both software and hardware, such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Networks, 
                Object Oriented Programming, SQL programming, etc. All the cources helped me in knowing and futher understand 
                how computers work and help us in building an application. Apart from the acedamics, I also interacted with
                many students from various diversities which helped me in develping a great personality and skills like team 
                player, self motivated, team leader.
