		<h2>I develop Softwares.</h2>
		<p >I'm a software developer, currently in Hyderabad (India). I get excited by the technologies, methods, frameworks and other
        people who are making an impact to change the world 
			for a better future.  I'm<br>
			- ready for the problems, so why don't you throw me one.<br>
			- looking for ways to explore this great world of technology.<br>
			- hungry to learn new things, experience new moments and if I can teach others what I have discovered so far.<br>
